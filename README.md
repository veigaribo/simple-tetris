Tetris clone as demonstrated by javidx9 at <https://youtu.be/8OK8_tHeCIA>.

This version, however, is tweaked mainly to run on Linux systems.

Currently the player needs to press Enter for the game to register their last
input. I was not able to find a way to make it better without requiring root
privileges. Also the controls are A/S/D instead of the arrow keys.
